# Color Flipper

January 2022

I did this project inorder to practice Javascript.

I created a Color Flipper that changes the background color to a random color stored inside an array, every time the button is clicked.

I got to practice working with an Array, creating a function that generates a random number, updating HTML with the `textContent` and `backgroundColor` properties.

I used water.css to add some basic styles.
